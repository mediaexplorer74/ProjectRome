## About this strange "collection"

This is only my experimentations with "Microsoft Project Rome":

1 AltProjectRome My simplest "telepresence" app (switch off server/remote screenshot, etc.);

2 RomeCastRemote (Remote podcasts controlling);

3 MediaExperience (Remote media clips controlling);

4 Nearby-Sharing-Windows (ProjectRome's Android adaptaion).

## Status
